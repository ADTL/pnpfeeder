- It is fully 3d printable.
- Has automatic tape cover removal
- Tape cover removal does not need any special controller. Just simple microswitch and 5v-12v supply
- Tape cover removal method can be used on many other feeder designs
- Tape advancing mechanism can be used with a servo or tape drag method which is used on OpenPNP.
- Only few M2 and M3 screws and few springs or rubber bands to assemble
- You can customize it to your machine needs
- Need 1.5 cm free space between feeders
